The tournament shall be played in the Swiss style meaning that no team drops out. 
Matching is done based on amount of points. Teams with similar amount of points play against each other.
But no team should play against each other if they have already faced each other in the tournament.
Typically a win, in a game, is considered 1 point. A tie is 0.5 points and loss is 0 points.

But at this tournament the leaderboard will not consist of points accoring to win/ties/losses.
It will consist of amount of points scored during each game played. 
Technically a team could lose all games and still end up at the top of the leaderboards.

The code will be tested in a small tournament with 3 games of 30 minutes. 
A maximum of 6 rounds of tichu can be played in those 30 minutes.
This is to incentivize the teams to play fairly and play as much as possible.
